# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-24)

**Core value:** Product teams can quickly find, review, constrain, modify, comment on, and approve translations, then send approved changes back through the standard Bitbucket Cloud pull request workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Platform Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- V1 targets Bitbucket Cloud only.
- Frontend and backend are separate applications.
- Frontend uses React, Vite, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui.
- Backend uses Python, FastAPI, OAuth2, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic.
- V1 authentication uses internal accounts with corporate email as the unique login identifier and password credentials managed by VerboFlex.
- The first admin is created through a CLI bootstrap command; password reset is admin-managed and requires a password change on first login.
- Microsoft Entra ID/OIDC authentication remains a future integration; the internal role model must stay provider-independent.
- Background work uses Celery and Redis.
- V1 supports Android XML, Qt `.ts`, JSON, and iOS `.strings`.
- V1 uses simple draft/approved/rejected review states and per-translation comments.
- Every phase closes with tests, code review, and deploy/build smoke verification.
- Figma, extra validators, external identity, and complex approval gates are deferred.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 must decide Bitbucket Cloud credential type and least-privilege scope model.
- Phase 4 must clarify JSON shape conventions and Qt `.ts` edit scope.
- Phase 8 must define exact allowed product-specific PR grouping options.
